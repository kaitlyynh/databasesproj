Here are the instructions to run our application locally: 
Before starting, make sure that you are referring to the "final" branch of this Github repository. 
The contents of our application are located in the branch named "final" instead of any other branch
that may exist. 

To run the Flask app, navigate into databasesproj -> appFolder -> run.py 

To execute run.py, either press the Play Button in your IDE with the run.py file open, OR try this:

1. 
		export FLASK_DEBUG=1
2. 
		flask run

Note: the "export" statement is optional, it will just set the application debugger mode to ON, but this is
for development purposes.


The web application is accessible locally on URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/
